# LeetCode-my-solutions (Raphael)

Here I will post my solutions for the [daily problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) in LeetCode and eventually the solutions for [study plans](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/) available. LeetCode is a platform intended for preparation for coding interviews, but I use it for practice purposes both to improve my current skills and to learn new ones.

I will try to optimize my daily solutions to present runtime higher than 50-70% of the other Python3 users. I will also try to reduce memory usage (e.g. without importing libraries), but note that this value varies in the platform each time you submit the code. Python3 solutions will be presented daily, whereas C or JavaScript solutions will be used for training.
